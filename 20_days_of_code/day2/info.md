For Day 2 of this challenge, I have made a simple webpage using openweathermap API keys, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The webpage asks for your location and displays the realtime weather sourced from openweathermap.

[CODE]()

Test Cases : None

Improvements : I could not get the icon indicating the weather conditions to show desipte many efforts. Perhaps an ordeal for later!
