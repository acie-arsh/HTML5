For Day 1 of this challenge, I have made a simple button using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that greets you using a browser alert when clicked.

[CODE](https://github.com/acie-arsh/HTML5/blob/main/20_days_of_code/day1/greeting.html)

Test Cases : None

Improvements: I would like to delay the onclick function in the future so the button transition may fully occur.
